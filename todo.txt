polyblep
dont plot too often (throttle)
dont trigger gc from the callback - dispatch all to ui
hard sync
integrate blit / PWM triangle
custom color scheme
sampler
better serialization
automation groups
better pattern edit
play note on enter
make it faster
detach sequencer
multiple synths + select target in sequencer
pass automation to last active voice
simplify plot (sample max# at default SR of 1000?)
make stuff more self contained => unit::plot/env::plot/synth::plot(plotoutput&)
fast log/sin approx?
envmodel private to dsp
bpm to sequencer
env1->amp
colspan ui
param interpolation
globaldsp
global=env1->amp+amp
PlotOutput0
make plot functions stateless
hide controls when off
check static_casts
make sure zero length adr has no plot data
