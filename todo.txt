polyblep, hard sync, integrate blit / PWM triangle
dont plot too often (throttle)
dont trigger gc from the callback - dispatch all to ui
sampler
better serialization
automation groups
better pattern edit, play note on enter, edit step
make it faster
detach sequencer
multiple synths + select target in sequencer
fast log/sin approx?
notifyparamchange + recalc + param interpolation
env to pitch
random lfo
noise generator
check which params should be automatable
connect mod sources
drag outside screen
merge lfo/unit plot 
no zero length lfo
filter lfos
lfo NOT key sync
fix step len -> int frames ?
init with streampos / derive stuff from streampos ?
split audioinput / stateinput
phase modulation
init/update(Model) -> do logs at start of env
global (not per-voice) stuff: lfos, filters
do voices in the synth, not the sequencer
automate everything (per-voice startup)
reconsider automating running voices
